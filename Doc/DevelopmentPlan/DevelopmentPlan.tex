\section{Git Workflow Plan}
We will adopt a feature-branch workflow plan. We will have a separate development (and the feature branches) and release branches.

\subsection{Label Useage}
Upon merging the different branches to master, we will tag the version of the product (for example ver 0.1, ver 1.2, etc).

\subsection{Milestones}
We have determined several key milestones in our project development and each milestone is broken down to several tasks. Currently we have planned for the following milestones (changes may be made along the way):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement document
    \item POC demonstration
    \item Version 1
    \item Version 2
    \item Testing
    \item Final Version
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
For our teamâ€™s proof of concept demonstration, we would like to show the feasibility of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creating a working tower class, the attacking unit that users can put on the field,  that is capable of firing projectiles only within range.
    \item Creating a working enemy class, the unit that will walk through the designated path and have a hit point (HP).
    \item Ensuring a proper projectile collision detection between the projectile to the enemy.
    \item Creating a good layout design for the game.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technology}
The programming language we are using are Python 2.7 and pygame 1.9.3. For IDE we are using the Python default IDLE. Testing framework will be Python unittest. And we will use LaTex for document generation.

\section{Coding Style}
The team understands the importance of having a coding standard. We will be following the Google Python Style Guide to ensure that the code that the team generate is consistent throughout.
